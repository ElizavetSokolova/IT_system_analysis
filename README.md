## CASE DESCRIPTION

Downtime in modern IT systems is extremely costly. To avoid it, monitoring systems must help people identify anomalies in system behavior based on collected telemetry data and promptly notify operators and the technical team.

I analyzed time series data to identify relationships between various system metrics at the moment anomalies occur.

By "relationships," I mean clear correlations in metric behavior at specific times within the system's operation. For example, as the number of requests processed by the system increases, the time required to process them also rises. Solving such problems allows monitoring systems to highlight only critical data during incidents and simplifies root cause analysis of faults.

## Input Data 

A snapshot of telemetry data from a real system covering a month of operation, recorded at one-minute intervals for analysis and solution development.
